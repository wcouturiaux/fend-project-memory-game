## Instructions

The starter project has some HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of the Memory Game project. You'll need to convert this project from a static project to an interactive one. This will require modifying the HTML and CSS files, but primarily the JavaScript file.

To get started, open `js/app.js` and start building out the app's functionality

For specific, detailed instructions, look at the project instructions in the [Udacity Classroom](https://classroom.udacity.com/me).

## Contributing

This repository is the starter code for _all_ Udacity students. Therefore, we most likely will not accept pull requests.

## How To Play

1. Open index.html

2. Click on 'cards' until all matches have been made

## About Game

Timer will start when first card is clicked.

After 10, 13, 16, and 19 moves (opening 2 cards) a star will be removed until none are left.

When all matches are made a modal will display the time elapsed to find all matches and how many moves it took.
